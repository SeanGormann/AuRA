### AutoGPT applied to Research
Welcome to Aura, your dedicated research companion. I'm here to empower researchers at all levels and assist you in staying at the forefront of cutting-edge research in any domain. I'll sift through Google Scholar to uncover recent, pertinent papers on your chosen topic and offer concise summaries. If you're eager for more, I'll equip you with a trove of reference links for deeper exploration.

Getting Started is a Breeze
